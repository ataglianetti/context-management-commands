description: Add new replies from email/Slack/Teams to Thread note
---

**Input:**
- If thread content is pasted below, use that
- If no content provided, read from clipboard using `pbpaste`

**1. Parse the new message**
- Extract sender, timestamp, and body from the pasted reply
- Format using the same pattern as /save-thread:
  `**[[Person Name]] – [[YYYY-MM-DD|M/D/YYYY]] h:mm AM/PM**`

**2. Find the existing thread note**

Search in `Calendar/` folder for notes with `type: Thread`.

**Matching strategy (combine signals, don't rely on any single one):**
- `with:` property includes the sender or other participants
- `about:` property matches projects/products mentioned in the reply
- Thread section contains matching participants or conversation flow
- Subject line similarity (helpful signal, but don't rely solely on it since subjects get edited for clarity)

**Disambiguation:**
- If exactly one match: proceed automatically
- If multiple matches: show candidates with one-liner and ask user to confirm
- If no matches: ask user if this is a new thread (offer to run /save-thread instead)

**3. Append the new message**
- Add `---` separator after the last message in the Thread section
- Append the formatted new message
- Clean up signatures, email footers, and boilerplate

**4. Update the filename and all references**
- Extract date from the new message
- Rename file from `YYYY-MM-DD Title` to `NEW-DATE Title`
- **Critical:** Search the entire vault for wikilinks referencing the old filename and update them to the new filename
  - Pattern to find: `[[old-filename]]` or `[[old-filename|alias]]`
  - Update to: `[[new-filename]]` or `[[new-filename|alias]]` (preserve aliases)
- Update `created:` property to reflect original thread date (keep as-is)

**5. Update metadata**
- Add any new participants to `with:` property
- Add any new projects mentioned to `about:` property

**6. Update note content if the new message changes the thread's state**
- **Summary:** Update if the new message resolves a discussion, changes direction, or adds significant new information
- **Key Points:** Update if decisions were made, positions changed, or new action items emerged
- **one-liner:** Update if the thread's focus or outcome has shifted
- Skip updates if the new message is just a minor acknowledgment that doesn't change the thread's substance

**Output:**
- Show the appended message (not the full thread)
- Confirm: filename change, wikilink updates (count)
- If any wikilinks couldn't be updated, list them

**Rules:**
- ALL person names use `[[First Last]]` wikilinks
- Separate messages with `---`
- Preserve existing thread formatting
